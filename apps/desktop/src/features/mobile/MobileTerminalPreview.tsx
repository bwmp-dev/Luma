/*
 * A live, read-only miniature of an open session, shown on the Connections card
 * for that session. terminalManager.mirrorSession does all the work: it creates
 * a display-only terminal seeded with the tail of the source's buffer and feeds
 * it the same output bytes the source receives. This component only owns the
 * host element and the lifetime — no terminal bytes pass through React.
 *
 * The mirror keeps the SOURCE's grid AND the source's font size rather than
 * refitting to the card, so xterm rasterizes exactly what the terminal
 * rasterizes: same wrap points, same right-aligned prompt segments, same TUI
 * layout, same glyphs. fitPreview then scales that rendering into the card with
 * a CSS transform — the terminal itself, drawn smaller, rather than a second
 * terminal re-rendered at a tiny font.
 *
 * A mirror is a second xterm instance, so one is only kept alive while its card
 * is actually on screen: scrolling a card out of view tears its mirror down, and
 * scrolling back re-seeds a fresh one from the source's current buffer. That
 * keeps the cost proportional to what is visible rather than to how many
 * sessions are open.
