 * had the entry points — the terminal's long-press "Share terminal…", the
 * `luma://join` deep link, and the Collaboration settings screen — but nothing
 * displayed what they opened.
 *
 * The viewer is written as an overlay filling its positioned ancestor (the
 * desktop's main area). The mobile shell has no such container, so it is given a
 * fixed one, rendered only while a room is actually being viewed: an always-
 * mounted full-screen layer would swallow every touch behind it.
