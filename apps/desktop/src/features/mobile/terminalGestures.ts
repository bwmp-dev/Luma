/*
 * Touch gestures for the mobile terminal, kept as a pure state machine so the
 * recognition rules are testable without a DOM. useTerminalGestures feeds it
 * coordinates and timestamps and forwards whatever it emits to
 * terminalManager.sendAccessoryKey — the same synthetic-key path the accessory
 * bar uses, so terminal bytes still never pass through React.
 *
 * Two gestures, each independently toggleable in settings:
 *   - Long-press, then drag: opens a floating d-pad and emits one arrow key per
 *     ARROW_STEP_PX of travel, so a drag scrubs through shell history (vertical)
 *     or along the input line (horizontal).
 *   - Double-tap: sends Tab, for shell completion.
 *
 * A drag that starts before the long-press timer fires is a scroll or a
 * selection: the machine steps aside and lets xterm handle it untouched. That
 * "rejected" state is what keeps the terminal's normal touch behaviour intact.
