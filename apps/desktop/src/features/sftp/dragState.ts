 * In-window drag payload for dragging file rows between the two SFTP panes.

 * keep the live payload in a module variable to drive drop-target styling and
 * the actual drop. This is app-local DnD only — no OS file drops.
 *
 * The payload identifies the source PANE, not local-vs-remote: either pane can
 * hold either kind of endpoint, including two different hosts.
