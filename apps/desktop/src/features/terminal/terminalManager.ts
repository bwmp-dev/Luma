   * rasterizes the identical grid at the identical size, so every line wraps
   * where it wrapped in the real session, right-aligned prompt segments stay
   * right-aligned, and a full-screen TUI addressing absolute cursor positions

  /**
   * Fit a preview mirror to its card by SCALING THE WHOLE TERMINAL DOWN, rather
   * than re-rendering it smaller.
   *
   * The mirror keeps the source's columns AND the source's font size, so xterm
   * lays out and rasterizes exactly what the real terminal does — same cell
   * metrics, same wrap points, same glyphs. A CSS transform then shrinks that
   * rendering to the card. The card is therefore a photograph of the terminal,
   * which is what "1:1" means here; re-fitting the font instead would give a
   * differently-hinted, differently-rounded grid that only resembles it.
   *
   * The scale comes from width alone: the source's columns are what decide every
   * wrap point, so they must fit. Rows are then set to whatever the scaled card
   * can show, because a phone terminal is tall and narrow while its card is
   * short and wide — demanding the rows fit too would drive the scale to the
   * floor. Rows do not affect wrapping, so the preview shows the tail of the
   * session (the most recent output, which is what the card is read for) at a
   * legible size. The cost is that a full-screen TUI is cropped to its last N
   * lines rather than shown whole.
   *
   * The scale is clamped to MIN_PREVIEW_SCALE, so a very wide source stops
   * shrinking and is clipped at the right edge instead of becoming a grey smear,
   * and to MAX_PREVIEW_SCALE so a narrow grid in a wide card is never drawn
   * larger than the terminal itself.
   *
   * Returns the scale applied, or null when nothing could be measured yet (not a
   * preview, not attached, or laid out to zero).
   *

   * but not free, and a card only needs the tail.
