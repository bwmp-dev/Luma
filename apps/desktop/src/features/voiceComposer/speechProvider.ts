/*
 * Pluggable transcription provider for the voice composer.
 *
 * THE HONEST SITUATION, because the UI has to say it out loud:
 *
 *  - The only speech engine reachable from a Tauri webview without shipping a
 *    new native dependency is the Web Speech API. Luma does NOT bundle an
 *    offline model (whisper.cpp, ONNX and friends are deliberately out of
 *    scope — they would add tens of megabytes of native code).
 *
 *  - On macOS and iOS the app runs in WKWebView, which does not expose
 *    SpeechRecognition to web content at all. There is therefore no dictation
 *    on Apple platforms, and the composer says so rather than pretending.
 *
 *  - On Windows the app runs in WebView2 (Chromium), where SpeechRecognition
 *    DOES exist — but classically it streams audio to the browser vendor's
 *    cloud service. That is at odds with Luma's local-first stance, which is
 *    why dictation is opt-in (default OFF) and why the settings toggle states
 *    plainly where the audio goes.
 *
 *  - Newer Chromium exposes a `processLocally` flag requesting on-device
 *    recognition. We feature-detect it and ask for it, but we cannot verify
 *    that the engine honours it, so we never claim it is on-device — and if
 *    the engine rejects the local-only request we retry over the cloud and
 *    surface a notice saying exactly that.
 *
 * Everything below is feature detection at runtime. No version sniffing, no
 * fabricated provider, no API-key field.
