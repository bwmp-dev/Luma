  <h1>Luma</h1>
</div>

A lightweight, cross-platform terminal and SSH client for Windows, macOS,
Linux, iOS, and Android, built with Tauri instead of Electron.

Luma combines local and serial terminals, saved SSH connections, SFTP, and
encrypted configuration sync in a modern interface. Local use requires no
account. You can bring your own sync provider or sign in for optional Luma
Cloud sync.

> **Status: early development.** Most core workflows are implemented, but the
> project has not reached a stable release. Expect rough edges and breaking
> changes.

## Features

### Terminals

- Local terminals backed by native PTYs and rendered with xterm.js
- Automatic shell discovery plus configurable shell profiles, working
  directories, and environment variables
- Tabs and horizontal or vertical split panes
- Terminal search, clickable links, configurable scrollback, and WebGL
  rendering where available
- Serial terminals with selectable port and baud rate
- Optional workspace persistence and restoration

### SSH and host management

- Saved hosts, groups, favorites, tags, search, and recent connections
- A single embedded SSH engine via russh across desktop and mobile, including
  private-key, password, keyboard-interactive, and ProxyJump connections
- Reusable named identities with usernames and optional key references;
  passwords use the OS credential store on desktop and support encrypted sync
- Encrypted and passphrase-protected private keys, public-key derivation, and
  SSH certificates
- Device-bound SSH-agent identities on desktop, including FIDO2 `sk-*` and
  platform-provider keys; signing and user-presence checks stay in the provider
- Explicit, disabled-by-default SSH agent forwarding with a per-session warning
  and persistent active-session indicator
- ProxyJump, keepalive, startup commands, working directories, and per-host
  environment variables
- Explicit unknown-host confirmation and changed-host-key warnings
- Import hosts and keys from PuTTY, and hosts from OpenSSH config, Tabby, and Electerm
- Parsed connection errors with reconnect support

### SFTP and productivity

- Dual-pane local/remote SFTP browser
- Create, rename, and delete files and directories
- File and directory upload and download, including drag-and-drop between panes,
  with per-file and whole-folder aggregate progress, cancellation, and retry
- Recursive directory transfers that report skipped symlinks and per-entry
  failures, with retry limited to the failed or incomplete entries
- Saved snippets with a parameterized snippet runner
- Local and remote port forwarding
- Searchable command palette

### Security, backup, and updates

- SQLite-backed settings and metadata with versioned migrations
- Private keys and passphrases encrypted with Argon2id and
  XChaCha20-Poly1305
- Optional OS keychain storage through Windows Credential Manager, macOS
  Keychain, or Linux Secret Service
- End-to-end-encrypted sync through a local folder, WebDAV, GitHub Gist, or
  Luma Cloud
- Sync conflict detection and resolution, plus encrypted backup import/export
- Redacting application logs and narrowly scoped Tauri capabilities
- Signed in-app updates and cross-platform release automation

## Stack

- **Application:** Tauri 2, Rust, Tokio
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, TanStack Query, Tailwind
  CSS, Radix UI, xterm.js
- **Backend:** portable-pty, embedded SSH via russh, SQLite via SQLx,
  russh-sftp, serialport
- **Security:** keyring, Argon2id, XChaCha20-Poly1305

Terminal byte streams flow directly between the Rust backend and xterm.js
through Tauri channels. React stores session metadata, not terminal output.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 or newer
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- The [Tauri platform prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)
  for your operating system
On Linux, serial support also requires the libudev development package (for
example, `libudev-dev` on Ubuntu).

### Run locally

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

Run only the browser frontend with:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Backend-dependent features are unavailable in that mode.

### Run on iOS

iOS development requires macOS, Xcode with an iOS platform installed, and the
Rust iOS targets. Install the targets once:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios
```

If `apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/apple` is not present in a fresh checkout, generate the Xcode
project once with `pnpm tauri ios init`. Then launch Luma on a connected iPhone
or an installed simulator:

```sh
pnpm ios:dev
```

The Tauri CLI prompts for the destination. For a physical device, select your
Apple development team in the generated Xcode project when prompted by Xcode.
Create a release archive with `pnpm ios:build`; App Store distribution also
requires a unique bundle identifier and the corresponding signing profile.

### Run on Android

The checked-in Android project is in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/android`. The repository's
Android workflow is a PowerShell helper for Windows hosts. Install Android
Studio with the Android SDK and NDK, JDK 21, and the Rust Android targets needed
by the connected device or emulator. Android Studio's bundled Java runtime is
supported.

Start an emulator or connect an Android device, then run:

```sh
pnpm android:dev
```

The helper selects Java 21 from `JAVA_HOME`, Android Studio, or common JDK
install locations before starting `pnpm tauri android dev`.

### Checks and builds

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
cargo fmt --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml
pnpm tauri build
```

CI runs frontend linting, tests, and builds, plus Rust formatting, Clippy,
tests, and native bundle builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Community

Join the [Luma Discord server](https://discord.gg/ebJVw3pXm6) for help,
questions, and project discussion.

The source code, issue tracker, and releases are available in the
[Luma GitHub repository](https://github.com/bwmp-dev/Luma).

## Releases

Release Please manages versions, changelogs, tags, and draft GitHub releases
from Conventional Commits. Release workflows build installers for Windows,
macOS, and Linux, sign updater artifacts, generate checksums, and publish the
release after verification.

WinGet, AUR, Homebrew, Snap, and direct Flatpak packaging is maintained under
[`packaging/`](packaging/README.md). Channel manifests are generated from the
published GitHub release and its checksums, then validated or published through
the manually dispatched distribution workflow.

The updater values in the checked-in Tauri configuration are CI placeholders.
A local production bundle must provide its own valid updater endpoint and
public key.
